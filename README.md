# KanColle English Textures
Translated textures to be used in the MyCache folder of POI when playing KanColle.

Use at your own risk, make sure to clear your cache every so often.
(No bans) as the API is never touched. 

To be used with POI, KCCacheProxy and eventually KC3 KaiNi (When released)

To use: (POI)
Download the master and set the kcs2 folder inside your Kancolle folder inside of the 3rd Party Cache folder.

To use: (KCCP)
Download the master and extract it inside another folder, containing only the master folder and the .mod.json required (see KCCacheProxy wiki for more details). Add the mod from KCCacheProxy using the instructions on the proxy wiki.
